# Decision-Tree-Regressor-Model-Variability-and-Bias-Varinace-Trade-Off-
This project is based on insurance datasets which was collected from Kaggle. Though, the decision tree model highly suffers from low bias and high variance .i.e. overfitting. But, we can adjust make it lower by adjusting the maximum depth of the tree. So, choosing the depth of the tree is more important while building decision tree model. I tried to fix the problem by tuning the depth through iteration through a certain range, which I tried to clearly explained through visualization.
